Apotheosis is a mod about adding additional layers of content to vanilla systems.  It doesn't add much in the way of blocks or items, but it adds a significant amount of content.
It's divided into modules, each separate from another.  Any module can be disabled at will, but all the modules work best when they are all enabled.

Apotheosis: Enchantment Overkill Edition is an enchantment enthusiast's wet dream, give it a try and see how crazy your enchantments can go!



The following modules are present:
* Enchanting: Adds a ton of extra enchantments, uncaps the enchanting table, and edits some core mechanics of the game.
* * Enchantment Overkill: The base Eterna, Quanta, and Arcana values for bookshelves are changed from their default values to 100%.
* * Anvil: Anvils can be enchanted, and are also uncapped.
